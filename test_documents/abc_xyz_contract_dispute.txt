In January 2024, ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and XYZ Solutions LLP entered into a detailed software development contract, setting July 31st, 2024 as the final delivery date for an enterprise suite priced at ₹2.5 crore. On 10.01.2024, ABC transferred an initial advance of ₹1 crore. The first joint review took place on 25 Jan 2024 at ABC's office, where project teams discussed technical customization. By 15th February, XYZ presented a working roadmap during a virtual meeting, followed by ABC's request for additional modules on February 28, 2024.

On 5th March, XYZ circulated their milestone report; however, ABC emailed concerns on 8/3/2024 over missed functional targets. Nevertheless, ABC paid a further ₹75 lakh on March 18, 2024, contingent on improved timelines. Weekly updates from April through May 2024 underscored persistent backend issues. On 21 May, ABC's CTO visited XYZ's premises for a progress demo, uncovering significant database shortcomings.

June 5th saw ABC issue a written warning regarding milestone defaults, referencing reliance losses and penalty provisions. XYZ requested an extension until 31.08.2024 in a letter dated 22 June, which ABC promptly rejected on 30/06/2024 due to its growing losses. Several negotiation meetings between 5 July and 20th July ended inconclusively, leading ABC to serve a breach notice on August 2, demanding project completion or a ₹1.75 crore refund. XYZ responded on 10 Aug, proposing to refund only ₹50 lakh and pushing for revised delivery timelines.

On 18-08-2024, ABC filed a Commercial Suit before the Delhi High Court, seeking specific performance, damages of ₹1 crore, recovery of all advances, and an interim injunction to prevent XYZ from licensing competing software. The defendant's Written Statement, dated 10 September 2024, argued that technical snags, evolving requirements, and Covid-related disruptions amounted to force majeure and justified delay under Section 56 of the Contract Act. XYZ also filed a dismissal application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC on 15.09.2024, challenging the legal foundation of ABC's claim.

Across September to November, evidence was submitted, including February–August email trails, board meeting minutes, technical expert reports, and payment records. Oral arguments commenced on 22 November, with ABC relying on contract terms and liquidated damages, while XYZ pressed the doctrine of frustration and cited partial fulfillment. On 20.12.2024, the High Court issued its judgment, directing XYZ to refund ₹1 crore, pay damages of ₹50 lakh, and restraining XYZ from using the software for two years. XYZ appealed the damages figure on 15 January 2025, and in a May 2025 ruling, the appellate court affirmed liability but reduced damages to ₹30 lakh, with all unresolved matters sent for mediation. This litigation featured a sequence of contractual execution, escalating technical disputes, formal notices, strategic pleadings, ongoing evidence, and final orders spanning more than a year.
